This VS2010 build is still a work in progress.  Currently there are a couple of 
steps that are still required to build Gridlabd in VS2010 that were automated in
VS2005.

1. Extract the xerces-c-3.1.1 release.  I have included it in zip form in the 
third_party directory.  Extract it in that directory.

2. You must build the release configuration.  This is a problem we had in 2005 as
well.  I don't like it, but for some reason symbols aren't getting properly exported
in some third party libraries under the debug configuration.  I want to fix this,
but for now build the release configuration, not the debug.
